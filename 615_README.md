# CS 615 Final Project - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

**Submission Date:** March 20, 2025  
**Team Members:** William Lien, Shawn Thomas, Shobhit Dixit, Rutvij Upadhyay  

## Overview
This project explores four separate Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to analyze image datasets. Each model has been designed based on specific frameworks, chosen to accommodate the unique requirements of different architectures.

## Project Structure
This notebook hosts **four distinct CNN models**:
1. **Base Model**
2. **Multi-Kernel Model**
3. **RGB Model**
4. **Multi-CNN Layer Model**

Each model is structured in its own section and requires specific configurations for execution.

## How to Use
### Step 1: Load Parameters
Before running any model, execute the **PARAMETERS** section to ensure all necessary hyperparameters and configurations are set.

### Step 2: Load Dataset
Run the **LOAD DATASET** section to import the necessary images and pre-process them for training.

### Step 3: Run the Desired Model
Each of the four models has its own section, which includes:
- The functions necessary to **load images in the correct color settings**
- The appropriate **frameworks** to execute the model
- The **training process** for each model
- The **final loss and accuracy graphs** for evaluation

## Notes
While a consolidated framework for all models would have been ideal, challenges in standardization led to each model being structured independently. This approach ensures optimal functionality based on the specific needs of each architecture.

At the time of submission, the final **loss and accuracy graphs** for each model should be available within their respective sections.
